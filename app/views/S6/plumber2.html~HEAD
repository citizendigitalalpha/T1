                    <p>
                         To become a plumber, you'll do an industry-recognised
                         qualification eg a Level 3 (NVQ) Diploma in Domestic
                         Plumbing and Heating. The usual way to do this is through
                         an <a href="http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/" rel=
                         "external">apprenticeship</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         You could also take a foundation course in plumbing
                         skills at college. This may help you to find a trainee
                         position with a company. Once working, you can do further
                         training.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         There are short courses in plumbing offering useful
                         background knowledge, but won't qualify you as a plumber.

                         holidays if your firm offers an emergency call-out service.
                         Self-employed plumbers can work longer hours.

                         You can develop your skills by taking further training
                         in areas such as heating, ventilation and air-conditioning,
