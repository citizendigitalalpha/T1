                <p class="lede">An interview is a discussion in person, by phone or online, between you and and a potential  employer. The employer will want to see if you're the right person for the job, and it'll give you the chance to see if the job's one you want.</p>
                <p>It's your chance to make a good impression, and show the employer what you have to offer.</p>
                <p>Make sure you're prepared. Research the role and organisation, and prepare evidence and examples of your skills and experience.</p>

                <ul class="list list-bullet">
                <li>find out what kind of interview it'll be so you can prepare - it could be a panel interview, a work-based task, or a group discussion</li>
                <li>look again at the job description to see what sort of  person they're looking for, and think of examples you could give to show you'd be a good fit</li>
                <li>think about which areas of your CV and application the interviewer might ask you to    talk more about, and how you can relate them to the role</li>
                <li>prepare to talk about common subjects, like why you want the job, your strengths andweaknesses, and your relevant work and life experience</li>
                <li>prepare some questions about the role and the company to ask at    the end of theinterview, but don't ask about pay yet</li>
                <li>plan what you're going to wear - you'll need to dress smartly and appropriately for the job</li>
                <li>check how to get to the interview venue, and how long it'll take</li>
                <li>make sure you leave plenty of time to get there and arrive a little early</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="heading-medium" id="during">2. During the interview</h2>
                <ul class="list list-bullet">
                <li>make sure your phone's off</li>
                <li>look alert and attentive, speak clearly and confidently, and don't swear or use slang</li>
                <li>don't wear very glamorous clothes or strong perfume or aftershave</li>
                <li>give full answers, don't just say 'yes' or 'no'</li>
                <li>give examples of  when you've used certain skills</li>
                <li>when providing examples of your experience, describe the situation, the task, the action you took and the result of your action</li>
                <li>make sure you fully understand the questions you're asked, and ask for moreexplanation if you need to</li>
                <li>take your time thinking of your answer - it's fine to  say you need a moment to think</li>
                <li>be positive about your experiences, avoid negativity about yourself or any previous roles you've had</li>
                <li>don't lie – the interviewer may see through you and, even if you get the job, youremployer can dismiss you if they find out you've been dishonest</li>
                <li>don't let your nerves show too much – use breathing techniques and try to remember a few nerves are normal</li>
                <li>don't be arrogant and assume you've got the job – nothing turns off employers morethan someone who is disrespectful and over-confident</li>
                <li>don't discuss controversial topics like religion, politics or gender relations</li>

                <ul class="list list-bullet">
                <li>ask for feedback on your performance - if you weren't successful think about how youcould use their comments to improve for next time</li>
                <li>if you're offered a job and decide you don't want it, thank the employer politely, as you may want to work for them in future</li>
