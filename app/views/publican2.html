                    <p>
                         There are no set requirements, but you'll find it useful
                         to have experience in customer service at a supervisory
                         level, and some experience of bar work.

                    <p>
                         Some large pub chains run graduate management trainee
                         schemes that take about a year to complete. You'll usually
                         need relevant work experience and a degree or HND level
                         qualification in an area like:
                    </p>

                         <li>hospitality management with licensed retail</li>

                    <p>
                         To become a tenant or leaseholder, you'll need evidence
                         that you have the experience and managerial ability to run
                         a pub successfully. You'll also need to complete the
                         <a href="http://biiab.bii.org/home">BIIAB</a> Level 2 Award
                         for Personal Licence Holders.

                         It's possible for anybody with enough financial backing
                         to buy a pub or bar.

                    <p>
                         As a manager of a pub or bar that sells food, you'll
                         usually need a qualification in food safety. You can find
                         out more from the <a href="http://www.cieh.org/">Chartered

                         on the other hand, are business people in their own

                         You're likely to work long hours. Pubs and bars operate
                         flexible opening hours, with some open up to 24 hours a
                         day, 7 days a week.

                    <p>
                         Pubs can be very noisy and busy at key times of the day,
                         and your work would also involve carrying crates and moving
                         barrels at times.
