                    <h2 class="heading-large">1. Entry requirements</h2>
                    <p>To become a plumber, you'll do an industry-recognised
                    qualification eg a Level 3 (NVQ) Diploma in Domestic
                    Plumbing and Heating. The usual way to do this is through
                    an <a href="http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/" rel=
                    "external">apprenticeship</a>.</p>
                    <p>You could also take a foundation course in plumbing
                    skills at college. This may help you to find a trainee
                    position with a company. Once working, you can do further
                    training.</p>
                    <p>There are short courses in plumbing offering useful
                    background knowledge, but won't qualify you as a plumber.
