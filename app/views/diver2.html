                         You must pass a medical carried out by a doctor approved
                         by the <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/">Health and Safety Executive</a> (HSE) before you begin professional diver

                    <p>
                         You might find it useful to have experience of recreational
                         SCUBA diving before training as a commercial diver, but
                         this isn't essential. Many diving schools offer tests to
                         help you decide whether you'd be suited to working
                         underwater.

                         You don't need academic qualifications to learn diving
                         skills, but to work as a commercial diver you'll need the
                         right skills, experience and qualifications for your
                         industry, like:

                         Diving is physically and mentally demanding. Conditions
                         underwater are often cold, dark and dirty, especially in
                         inland sites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         You'll wear protective clothing and breathing apparatus
                         appropriate to the depth and type of dive.

                    <p>
                         You'd normally be self-employed as a
                         commercial diver.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         With experience and further training, you could move into
                         roles with extra responsibility and more pay, like life
                         support technician or diving supervisor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         If working in a dive centre you could move into a
                         management role.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         You could also set up a business, or work in a related
                         field where diving skills are necessary, like swimming pool
                         engineering or maintenance.
